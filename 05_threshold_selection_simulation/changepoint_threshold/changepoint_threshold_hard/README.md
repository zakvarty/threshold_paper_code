## README for step_threshold_phased 

STORM code to select a stepped threshold for a collection of simulated catalogues. 
These catalgoues do not have hard censoring below the modelling threshold, v(\tau)
rather the censoring probability of unrounded magnitudes increases exponentially below the threshold.
